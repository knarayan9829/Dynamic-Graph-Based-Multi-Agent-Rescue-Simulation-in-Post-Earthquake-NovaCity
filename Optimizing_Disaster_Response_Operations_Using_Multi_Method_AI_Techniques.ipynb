        "\n",
        "An earthquake has struck NovaCity, causing widespread destruction, including fires, and road blockages. Emergency response teams need to be coordinated for rescue operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "The city is divided into **5 regions (R1 to R5)**. Each region has an evaluated **damage level** according to its blocked roads and fires:\n",
        "- High damage (H): $>=50\\%$ roads blocked, or $>=30\\%$ fires;\n",
        "- Medium damage (M): $[10\\%, 50\\%)$ roads blocked, or $[10\\%, 30\\%)$ fires; and\n",
        "- Low damage (L): $<10\\%$ roads blocked, or $<10\\%$ fires.\n",
        "\n",
        "Either blocked roads or fires that reach the range can be considered its damage level. For example, a region with 30\\% road blocks and 5\\% fires is Medium damaged.\n",
        "\n",
        "The **initial damage** to each region is provided:\n",
        "- R1 (H): 60\\% roads blocked, 35\\% fires;\n",
        "- R2 (M): 40\\% roads blocked, 25\\% fires;\n",
        "- R3 (M): 15\\% roads blocked, 5\\% fires;\n",
        "- R4 (H): 35\\% roads blocked, 30\\% fires; and\n",
        "- R5 (L): 5\\% roads blocked, 3\\% fires.\n",
        "\n",
        "Assume all regions are of equal size to simplify the modelling process. Each region is modelled as a **node** in a graph, and predefined **distances** between regions (e.g., 5 km between R1 and R2, 3 km between R2 and R3) are detailed: R1 -- R2: 5 km, R1 -- R3: 7 km, R1 -- R4: 4 km, R1 -- R5: 6 km, R2 -- R3: 3 km, R2 -- R4: 4 km, R2 -- R5: 8 km, R3 -- R4: 5 km, R3 -- R5: 6 km, and R4 -- R5: 4 km.\n",
        "\n",
        "During the rescue, each region will continue to experience fire spread and aftershocks. Fires spread every 10 minutes within the same region, increasing the fire percentage by 10\\%. Aftershocks occur randomly every 15 minutes increasing road blockages by 10\\% over all regions. For example, in R1, the initial damage is 60\\% roads blocked and 35\\% fires. After 10 minutes, it becomes $(60\\%, 45\\%)$, and after an additional 5 minutes, it becomes $(70\\%, 45\\%)$ if no rescue operations are performed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Rescue agents are distributed across regions at the start of the simulation. **Eight units of fire trucks start at R2.** Each fire truck unit decreases fire percentage by 10\\% per rescue operation. **Six units of police start at R4.** Each police unit decreases road blockages by 10\\% per rescue operation. Multiple agents/units can perform rescue operations at the same time in the same region. The effects of their actions are cumulative. For example, if 2 fire trucks are deployed to R1 simultaneously, the fire percentage decreases by 20\\% in one operation. Rescue operations affect the regional damage directly. If a fire truck reduces fire percentage by 10\\%, that 10\\% decrease is applied to the overall fire damage in that region, e.g., $20\\%-10\\%=10\\%$.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Assumption:** Both rescue operations and disaster events (fire spread and aftershocks) do not consume time in this simulation, but each unit can only perform rescue once when visiting the region. Rescue agents will not lose resources along a path, and all operations will occur instantly for the purpose of modelling. However, the effects of disasters and rescues will still be cumulative over time. Rescue agents aim to follow a path that covers all regions, ensuring each region is visited only once. After completing their assigned rescue tasks along the path, they must return to their starting point for a refill.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Travel Speed:** Rescue agents can travel at a maximum speed of 60 km/h on unblocked roads. If roads are blocked, their speed will be reduced according to the percentage of blocked roads in the region they are traveling to or from. The travel speed between two regions is determined by the average percentage of blocked roads in both regions. For example, if R1 has 60\\% blocked roads and R2 has 40\\% blocked roads, the average blocked road percentage is $(60\\% + 40\\%) / 2 = 50\\%$. The travel speed will then be reduced by 50\\%, resulting in a travel speed of 30 km/h. Rescue agents won’t block each other. Fire damage will not affect travel speed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Rescue operations must be completed within 90 minutes and the sooner the better. You need to allocate resources efficiently, prioritize critical regions, and adapt to changing conditions like fire spread and aftershocks. Rescue agents must quickly respond to new blockages and worsening fires, adjusting strategies to minimize delays."

        "\n",
        "* Pheromone Initialization and Update: Initial pheromone levels were set for each path, and as agents moved, pheromones were deposited along successful paths. An evaporation function also reduced pheromone levels over time, encouraging agents to explore new routes.\n",
        "* Travel Time and Desirability Calculation: Travel times were dynamically adjusted based on road blockages, and desirability scores (based on inverse travel time) helped agents prioritize quicker paths.\n",
        "* Decision-Making with Pheromone Trails: Agents selected their next region based on a combination of pheromone levels and desirability, simulating the ACO approach where paths with high pheromone levels become more attractive.\n",
        "\n",
        "Through these steps, ACO provided a framework for adaptive and coordinated movement, with agents leaving pheromone trails to reinforce effective paths while adjusting to current disaster conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "How This Helps the Next Step:\n",
        "The paths generated by ACO serve as the initial population for the Genetic Algorithm (GA) in Task 1, ensuring that GA begins with a set of paths already optimized for current conditions. The pheromone trails also guide the GA's selection process, as paths with higher pheromone levels reflect successful rescue operations, enhancing the GA’s ability to find efficient and effective paths in the subsequent task."

        "* Defining the Network Structure and Dependencies:  \n",
        "Relationships between key variables were established, allowing each factor to influence related outcomes.\n",

        "Probabilities were assigned based on expected behaviors, enabling the network to compute how conditions impact rescue effectiveness.\n",
        "* Performing Inference:  \n",
        "The model allows probabilistic queries that provide insights into the likelihood of achieving specific levels of rescue effectiveness under given conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "How This Helps the Next Step:\n",
        "The Bayesian Network provides critical probabilistic insights for real-time decision-making. By evaluating the probability of successful rescue efforts under different conditions, the simulation can adjust strategies, prioritize regions, and allocate resources with a data-driven approach. This support for uncertainty handling ensures that rescue operations are better adapted to evolving conditions and resource availability, enhancing overall disaster response effectiveness."

        "## Conclusion\n",
        "The simulation of the disaster response operation provided valuable insights into resource allocation and decision-making during emergency situations. Over the course of the simulation, I learned the importance of adaptive strategies in response to dynamic conditions, as well as the interplay between fire spread, road blockages, and the efficacy of rescue operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Learnings:\n",
        "\n",
        "Resource Deployment: Effective management of fire trucks and police units is crucial. The simulation highlighted that while deploying resources, the order of operations significantly influences the outcome. High-priority regions must be addressed first to minimize overall damage and casualties.\n",
        "Path Optimization: The integration of Genetic Algorithms and Ant Colony Optimization was instrumental in finding efficient paths for rescue operations. This reinforced the value of optimization techniques in real-time decision-making scenarios.\n",
        "Impact of Disaster Dynamics: Understanding how quickly fires spread and road blockages develop allowed for more strategic planning of rescue missions. The iterative nature of the simulation demonstrated how quickly conditions could change, requiring ongoing assessment and adjustment of strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Improvements:\n",
        "\n",
        "Real-time Feedback Mechanism: Implementing a real-time feedback mechanism to adjust resource allocation dynamically based on current conditions could enhance the simulation’s responsiveness. This would allow for immediate reallocation of resources as the situation evolves, rather than following a predetermined path.\n",
        "Broader Unit Deployment: There were instances where not all available units were deployed. Incorporating a more strategic allocation algorithm that considers the number of remaining units and their optimal distribution across regions could prevent under-utilization of resources.\n",
        "Comprehensive Reporting: While the simulation provided insights into the number of deployed units, a more comprehensive report detailing the impact of each unit’s deployment on fire reduction and road blockage clearance would enhance understanding of the effectiveness of the rescue operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What Went Wrong:\n",
        "\n",
        "The simulation did not effectively clear all fires and road blockages by the end of the run, indicating a possible misalignment in the deployment strategy or a lack of sufficient units allocated to high-impact regions. Certain regions continued to have significant damage levels, which suggests that rescue operations need to be better prioritized based on the severity of damage and the potential for resource allocation.\n",
        "Some regions did not receive the expected number of fire and police units, which may indicate an issue in the logic for tracking and deploying units. This needs to be addressed to ensure that the simulation can accurately reflect the deployment of all available resources.\n",
        "In summary, the simulation has proven to be a valuable learning tool, demonstrating the complexities of disaster response and the critical need for adaptable, data-driven strategies in emergency management. Future iterations should aim to refine the allocation algorithms and improve the responsiveness of the system to ensure that all regions can be effectively cleared of hazards within the simulation timeframe."
